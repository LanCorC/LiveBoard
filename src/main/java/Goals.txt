Goals of this project:

1. Create a game board
2. This board, from the site .html, will track all user mouse position.
3. Position of other mouse (multiplayer) will be broadcast and rendered to other players.
4. This board can be rotated (mousewheel or arrows), while keeping coordinates.
5. This board can hold items.
6. Items can be moved and hidden (facedown, and vice versa).
7. Rendering of the item is client-side. Regardless of board rotation, the items always face the player's P.O.V.
    7.1 Note: P.O.V. = Point of View
        7.1.1 Note: If the board is tilted 90 degrees, the cards remain upright.
        7.1.2 Note: The items, separately, can be rotated (select/highlight then [mousewheel] or [arrows]).
            7.1.2.1: Independently rotated items retain their rotational property as rendered on client-side.
8. This board can be zoomed out from, as well as zoomed in.
    8.1: Items in the board retain their relative size. They will 'shrink' and 'grow' with the board.
